If the frequent words don't help us, how about the words that occur once only,
the so-called hapaxes? View them by typing fdist1.hapaxes(). This list contains
lexicographer, cetological, contraband, expostulations, and about 9,000 others. It
seems that there are too many rare words, and without seeing the context we
probably can't guess what half of the hapaxes mean in any case! Since neither
frequent nor infrequent words help, we need to try something else.
