3.2 Fine-grained Selection of Words
â€¢ Next, let's look at the long words of a text; perhaps these will
be more characteristic and informative. For this we adapt
some notation from set theory. We would like to find the
words from the vocabulary of the text that are more than 15
characters long. Let's call this property P, so that P(w) is true
if and only if w is more than 15 characters long. Now we can
express the words of interest using mathematical set notation
as shown in (1a). This means "the set of all w such that w is
an element of V (the vocabulary) and w has property P"
